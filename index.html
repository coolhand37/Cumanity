					[koo-man-i-tee]</span> <span class="quote">bringing community and humanity together based on the 
					understanding that when our sense of community is lost so is our humanity.</span>
					</p>
					<p>As a part of the human species we possess the innate ability to determine actions based on 
					emotions and logic. Over the years we’ve gotten away from focusing on what truly makes a community 
					great – The People. Cumanity is the notion that a place is only as great as the people around it. 
					But in an age of convenience, technology and downright greed, often times, life’s most important 
					fundamentals are so easily overlooked. The phrase “money can’t buy happiness” doesn’t seem as true 
			    today as it once was. Cumanity is dedicated to reminding everyone just how true that phrase really is.
